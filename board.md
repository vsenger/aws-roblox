Insight – Language Advisory Board
Q1 2023

SUMMARY
(The goal of this section is to provide context. Start with a one sentence mission for the team. Follow that with a high-level summary of the overall goals for the year, along with some specifics for what the team is focused on now. If there are overarching points that you want others to take away from this review, put them upfront here and give the supporting details later in the doc.)
The Language Advisory Board is a programming language specific committee with multiple AWS teams members 
like D.A.’s, S.A.’s, engineers, service teams and eventually external community members like heroes, community builders, Java Champions and user group leaders. 
The board goal is to reduce customer friction and improve developer experience for a specific programming language with long term actions.
This year we will launch two LABs: .NET and Java; we started with .NET in March, and we will start with Java in April.



HIGHLIGHTS
(Call out the biggest wins – around 3 to 5 – for the past month. These could be feature launches, completed goals, customer wins, adoption gains, or even major internal improvements around operations or cost. Use your judgement to focus on those that have the greatest impact on the overall business.)
.NET Advisory Board narrative – The .NET Language Advisory Board narrative has reached a first milestone and has been shared with several .NET stakeholder teams. It enabled to get buy in from 10 different teams.
.NET Advisory Board first meeting – On March 9th, the first .NET Language Advisory Board meeting occurred. After a roundtable allowing participants to discover each other. We ran a sticky note exercice to identify the already known .NET developer pain point. From this exercice, we’ve identified 7 .NET Big Theme that we will work on.
LOWLIGHTS
(Call out the biggest misses – around 3 – for the past month. These could be anything that are putting our goals at risk. Use your judgement to focus on those that have the greatest impact on the overall business.)
AWS TCX is missing in the .NET Advisory Board – The first meeting has highlighted that there were several points to address regarding the documentation for .NET developers: discoverability, completeness, fragmentation. Unfortunately, the AWS TCX had not been invited to join the board. We will fix this for the next meeting.
AWS Heroes meeting – We ran a meeting with AWS Heroes to share the Language Advisory Board initiative and validate with them they would agree to join meetings to discuss the actions we want to take to address Developer Experience issues. AWS Heroes were skeptical about this initiative as they know very well our 2-pizzas team model. They’ve challenged the fact that we will be able to move the needle. They told us that they’ve already provided a lot of feedback that have never been addressed. It demonstrates how armful it can be for AWS developer mindshare not to listen our community.
(OPTIONAL) BUILDER STORIES
(Share the most enlightening examples of recent conversations and qualitative data.)
Builder – Describe the builder background, their experience, what’s working, and what’s not. Detail any learnings, along with any action items with that particular customer.
TF1 – Add a conversation with .NET developers at TF1, the biggest French TV operator. They’ve decided to develop brand new .NET Cloud Native applications on AWS using .NET 6 & 7. They seize the opportunity to migrate on AWS to rewrite some .NET applications rather than modernization them. They are using AWS Lambda, API Gateway and Amazon DynamoDB. They are struggling with the local development workflow. As of now, they change their code, push the change to their Git repository and wait for the change to be deployed to their developer account to test if the change work. They were not aware of SAM cli and want to understand how SAM cli can fit with their usage of Visual Studio.
RISKS & CHALLENGES
(Summarize the top, strategic business risks or challenges. These could be long term challenges that we provide recurring updates on each month. Or these could be short term challenges that have high business impact.)
Setting up the Language Advisory Boards is time consuming. It requires a lot of engagement with the different stakeholders to get their buy-in to join. It also require orchestration  to prepare the meetings and ensure that follow up actions are deliverd. Then, we have less time to create content and work on other initiatives.
CURRENT FOCUS
(Share the big items that the team will work on in the upcoming month.)
.NET Developer Experience Big Picture (Yellow for Date) – In the next few months, the focus of the .NET Advisory Board will be to define the .NET Developer Experience Big Picture. It means to scope what are the key core services we are promoting to .NET developers, for which use cases and how we ensure that we provide a delightful and productive experience with those services.

GOALS

Briefly describe the goal, original due date, its current state, any risks or blockers, and next steps with a new target date if goal date missed.
